# Traffic Volume Prediction and Control

This repository contains a comprehensive project for predicting and controlling traffic volume using a combination of machine learning, deep learning, blockchain, and custom neural networks. The project utilizes various models and techniques to analyze traffic data, predict traffic volume, and provide actionable insights for traffic management.

## Project Structure

### traffic.ipynb

This Jupyter Notebook includes the following:

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Loading traffic data from Google Drive, checking for missing values, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualization of traffic volume distribution, traffic volume by hour of day, day of the week, and correlation analysis.
- **Time-Series Visualization**: Plotting traffic volume over time and creating wind rose plots.
- **Model Building and Training**: Implementing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost for traffic volume prediction.
- **Model Interpretability**: Using SHAP values to explain feature importance.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Using Isolation Forest to detect anomalies in traffic data.
- **Ensemble Modeling**: Combining predictions from MLP, Random Forest, and XGBoost models.
- **Traffic Volume Classification**: Using BERT for sequence classification to generate traffic management suggestions.
- **Blockchain Implementation**: Implementing a simple blockchain to store traffic data and predictions.
- **Output to CSV**: Writing predictions and suggested actions to a CSV file.

### main.ipynb

This Jupyter Notebook includes the following:

- **Custom Neural Network Class**: Building a simple neural network from scratch for traffic light control.
- **Training the Neural Network**: Training the network on sample data.
- **Testing the Neural Network**: Testing the network on sample inputs and comparing outputs with expected values.
- **Traffic Light Controller Simulation**: Simulating a traffic light controller using the trained neural network and displaying traffic light states with images.
